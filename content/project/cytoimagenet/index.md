summary: The goal of the study is to provide biologists a means to automatically extract biologically meaningful image features from their microscopy images. We seek to do so by compiling open-source microscopy datasets of cells to create a pretraining dataset for training popular Convolutional Neural Network architectures for transfer learning.
