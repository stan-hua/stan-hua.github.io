summary: Deep learning has shown useful in predicting obstructive hydronephrosis in children using only ultrasound images taken during a single visit. Patients typically take multiple ultrasounds each on separate hospital visits. We seek to improve the current 2D convolutional model by adapting it to the latest spatio-temporal methods.
