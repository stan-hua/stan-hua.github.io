I am passionate about answering meaningful questions through the use of software development and data science. I strongly value communicating complex concepts in a way that is easy to understand.

In my past AI/ML research experiences, I've tackled three questions, applied to healthcare:

1. If we train deep learning models (CNN) on biological images (CytoImageNet), does it learn more biologically-meaningful image features than models trained on images of every day objects (ImageNet)?

2. Can we improve ultrasound-based prediction of kidney disease, by adapting image-based deep learning models (2D CNNs) to take in all of a patient's data over time?

3. Does dimensionality (PCA) affect clustering (K-Means) of medical images under small sample sizes?


It truly is fascinating how intricate tools and techniqued can be woven together to create a simple yet impactful story.
