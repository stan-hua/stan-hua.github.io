Aspiring to become an industry data scientist, I am passionate about using data science tools to answer questions. I strongly value mentorship, and I enjoy the process of explaining concepts in a way that is easy for my listener to understand.

Previously a premed, my research experience with Prof. <a href="http://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca">Pascal Tyrrell</a> truly sparked my interest in the use of data science to create an impact. Here, I learnt about the problems that arise for statistical and deep learning models when there are too few data samples. My project focused on improving a methodology for capturing the effect of dataset heterogeneity (from small sample sizes) on CNN model training. Specifically, I focused on the effects of decisions made in the dimensionality reduction step (PCA) before cluster analysis.

On the other hand, my time with Prof. <a href="http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/">Alan Moses</a> and Dr. <a href="http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/alexlu/">Alex Lu</a> taught me about the challenges of handling vast amounts of unstardardized image data. Under their expertise, I curated and trained models on CytoImageNet, a large-scale dataset of openly-sourced microscopy image data in the hopes of providing biologists a fast and automatic means for extracting biologically-relevant information from their images. 

These experiences have deepened my appreciation for the data collection, storage and preprocessing pipelines that occur before modeling. 

I find it beautiful how a plethora of sophisticated tools can come together in harmony to create a simple yet potentially impactful story.
