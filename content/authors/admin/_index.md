Hi! My name is Stan, and I am currently a Software Engineer intern at Intel and a part-time Junior Machine Learning Specialist at SickKids.

I am passionate about answering meaningful questions through the use of sound software development and rigorous data science. I value the ability to communicate complex ideas in a way that is easy to understand.

<span style="margin-left: -2em">In the past, I've tackled three AI/ML research questions:</span>

<blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>If we train deep learning models (CNN) on biological images (CytoImageNet), does it learn more biologically-meaningful image features than models trained on images of every day objects (ImageNet)?</li>
            <li>Can we improve ultrasound image-based prediction of a kidney disease, by adapting image-based deep learning models (2D CNNs) to take in all of a patient's data over time?</li>
            <li>Does dimensionality (PCA) affect clustering (K-Means) of medical image features under small sample sizes?</li>
        </ol>
