**Hi!** My name is Stan, and I want to create robust yet cautious machine learning systems that can meaningfully improve patient care, especially for those in under-served communities.

I care deeply about the usefulness of machine learning when deployed clinically. My current research interests revolve around model/data bias and methods to improve robustness or uncertainty quantification.

I also believe in [slow science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_science), which is not about time to completion but about the careful and meticulous art of advancing science.

Shoot me an email if you'd like to chat! And if you include the word "stupefy" in your email, I'll know you read this :).
