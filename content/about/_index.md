**Hi!** My name is Stan. I am a future Data Scientist / Research Engineer!

Currently, I am applying to jobs and graduate school programs in the US, starting in 2024.

In the past, I've worked on interesting problems in difficult domains (healthcare, finance) with different types of data (images/videos, text, tabular).

Here are a couple of things I enjoy/value:
1. answering meaningful questions through novel yet rigorous data science
2. engineering of robust/scalable machine learning systems
3. communicating ideas in a way that builds intuition
4. [slow science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_science)

Congratulations if you've made it this far!

Do connect with me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email saying "Open sesame".

Would love to hear about you!
