**Hi!** My name is Stan, and I am currently a **Software Engineer intern** at Intel and a part-time **Junior Machine Learning Specialist** at SickKids.

I am passionate about answering meaningful questions through rigorous data science, sound software development and succinct presentation.

One of my favorite sayings: **K.I.S.S.** (Keep It Simple Stupid).
