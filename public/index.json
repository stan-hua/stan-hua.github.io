Tread carefully! \r OVERVIEW\rPrinciple Component Analysis (PCA) is known for two things: 1) Dimensionality Reduction, and 2) Structure Analysis. However more generally, it is used for factor extraction, which is needed in Factor Analysis.\nNOTE: There are plenty of resources online if you wish to learn more about Factor Analysis, but they will not be covered here!\r\rTERMINOLOGY\rSo as not to lose anyone, let\u0026rsquo;s define some useful terminology! Features are what we are measuring.\n\rExample\rSay we have a table with y rows and x columns, then we have x features. Imagine each row being the names of someone you know, and each column measure something distinct about all persons listed (e.g. their height, weight, deepest darkest secrets, etc.). These things we're measuring are the features.\n\rDimensionality Reduction is exactly what it sounds like. The goal is to reduce the number of dimensions (i.e. number of features), while retaining useful information from the original data.\n\rExample and Enrichment\rSay you wish to visualize your data, in order to get an understanding of the relationships between each feature. However, you have too many features. It becomes impossible to plot them on an x-y graph. How do you visualize this without destroying your computer let alone the laws of physics? Simple, you reduce the number of dimensions to 2. Now, you can plot it on a coordinate plane! NOTE: Dimensionality Reduction is different from Feature Selection (e.g. L1 Regularization, L2 Regularization, etc.). The goal of feature selection is to select the most important features. Meanwhile, dimensionality reduction is used to lessen the number of dimensions while capturing the variation in the original data as much as possible.\r\r\rGiven p features, Principal Components are the [1, min(n, p)] new variables extracted from n features using Principal Component Analysis. You can think of them as new axes to view the original data. However, you can no longer interpret the principal components the same way you did with previous features.\n\rEnrichment\rIf you have 10 features and you transform them via PCA to get 10 principal components, they are not the same. If you previously had age and weight, now you simply have axes for data points with no interpretable meaning unlike the original variables. With PCA, you may end up with combinations of these variables. Tell me, is there meaning in a new variable that is 30% age and 70% weight?\r\rGENERAL IDEA\rTo build intuition about what happens in Principal Component Analysis, let\u0026rsquo;s use the graph below as an example.\nHere, we have 2 features. You can imagine each point representing an observation (e.g. one of your participants).\nWhen you implement PCA, imagine a line placed at the mean (of all the data points). Imagine rotating it, and every time that you rotate it, it changes how far each observation (i.e. its projection onto the line) point is from the center of the line. This is also called the squared distances. And this is what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to maximize.\nBy doing so, it is as if we are trying to find a line where the observations are farthest from center. Thus, we capture the most amount of variation along this line, and this line is known as a principal component!\nOnce again, notice how the features no longer have anything to do with the new axes (principal component). Also notice that if you had 3 or more features, graphing it like we did is no longer possible.\nIn Part III, we will explore how to do PCA in Python. See you there!\nAdditional Resources\rStatQuest has great videos explaining what I mentioned with the graph with more detail!\n","date":1609718400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609631971,"objectID":"5a257e203e4cad81ec6f721dc5714afd","permalink":"/post/pca-part-ii/pca_part_2/","publishdate":"2021-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/pca-part-ii/pca_part_2/","section":"post","summary":"Here is a brief overview on Principal Component Analysis, one of the most popular methods of dimensionality reduction today!","tags":["Data Science"],"title":"PCA Part II.

With this information, the company would like to group their customers, in order to ascertain who are more likely to have risks to their health. To make a profit, the executives believe that customers in high-risk groups should be charged more expensive premiums. They decide to outsource this problem to you. Now, you are given a table with 100,000 customers and 1000 different column variables. What do you do?\nIf you’re stubborn, you can try to compare all 1000 variables for all 100,000 customers, but this is an impossible task, possibly even for a machine. There are simply way too many dimensions or variables to look at. What if you could inspect 2 or 3 variables instead? Though still a Herculean task for any human, it’s far more reasonable to compare two numbers than 1000.\nThis brings us to the Curse of Dimensionality, which tells us that as the number of dimensions in our data increase, the distance between our data points are going to become equal. This is important! Most methods of grouping people (or clustering data points) is based on Euclidean distance between points. Intuitively, this is to say that the customers cannot be differentiated from one another, so how do you cluster them into groups?\nGenerally, there are two ways you could reduce the dimensionality of your data. You can either select the top n number of most impactful variables related to health risk, such as age and occupation. Or you could represent those variables in another way. I am referring to 1) Feature Selection, and 2) Dimensionality Reduction. Make no mistake. They are very different methods!\n\rEnrichment\rNOTE: The new variables are combinations of the old variables. They will have no interpretable meaning. In feature selection, you’re simply keeping some variables and dropping the rest. Those variables retain their meaning!\n\r\r\nThe one I will be discussing soon is Dimensionality Reduction. The goal of which is to represent as much useful information in your data with the fewest number of dimensions.\nImagine all the useful information about your participants could be represented with one or more new variables that can explain almost as much as those 1000 variables. That is the essence of dimensionality reduction! Now, you can proceed with grouping the company’s customers.\nIn Part II, we will focus on building intuition for Principal Component Analysis, a frequently used dimensionality reduction method.

Now, how do you do this? Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s better to ask first what is your operating system (e.g. Windows, MacOS, etc.).\nThis post will show you 1) how to connect to a remote server on Windows, AND 2) how to 1mount the server on your computer on Windows and Debian.\nNOTE: This blog post assumes you know basic Unix commands. If not, I recommend learning some of the basics, then come back when you're done!\r\r 1. Simple access to server files via ssh (Secure Shell) \rBefore you start, you'll most likely be needing 3 things: 1) the username of your server account, 2) the server IP adress, and 3) the password associated with the server account if applicable. Okay, now open your command prompt via cmd.exe. Your command prompt command should generally follow what is displayed below.\r...\u0026gt; ssh username@125.950.26.789\r The command is \u0026ldquo;ssh\u0026rdquo; followed by your server username, \u0026ldquo;@\u0026rdquo;, and the server ip address. After which, you may be prompted by the console to input your password. After doing so, you should be connected. Congratulations!\nNOTE: This connection is temporary and will be gone once you exit the command prompt, or when your machine is powered off or loses connection to the internet. If so, you will need to enter the command again.\r\rSoon enough, you\u0026rsquo;ll realize the pain of having to do this every time you close the command prompt. Another option is to mount the server files. Then you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to view the files on your machine as if they were just any files on your desktop!\n2. Mounting server files via sshfs SSHFS is Linux-based and doesn\u0026rsquo;t come installed. See below on how to install it, and the command to mount server files on your computer.\nOn Windows First, download and install google\u0026rsquo;s latest win-sshfs package by clicking here. After doing this, you can simply input the following into your command line.\nnet use \\\\sshfs\\username@ip_address// #// brings you to your home dir. in the server\r##More examples\r#To connect at specific file path\rnet use \\\\sshfs\\username@ip_address//file-path\rnet use \\\\sshfs\\username@ip_address//Users\\Stanley\\Desktop\r#To enter password with command\rnet use \\\\sshfs\\username@ip_address//file-path /user:username password #space between file path and /user: argument\r NOTE: \"net use\" is used to map network drives to your computer.\r\rOn Debian Similar to Windows, you have to install sshfs for Debian, but this can all be done in the terminal! Follow the steps below to install, then mount the remote server on your machine\u0026hellip;\n#Install SSHFS\rsudo apt-get install sshfs\r#OPT: Create directory to mount server files on\rsudo mkdir /mnt/droplet\r#Mount\rsudo sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions username@ip_address:/file_path /mnt/droplet\r NOTE: Be careful of spaces!\r\r Additional Resources  SSHFS Mounting  1Mount ::= having the remote server's files on your local machine, accessible by file explorer.\r","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596326400,"objectID":"19740685cb881b481a6a828b96ca6c74","permalink":"/post/remote-server/connecting-to-remote-servers-via-ssfhs-ssh/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/remote-server/connecting-to-remote-servers-via-ssfhs-ssh/","section":"post","summary":"Adapting to remote work, learn quickly how to connect to a remote server from home using SSH and SSHFS!","tags":["Other"],"title":"Connecting to a remote server","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Python"],"content":"\r\rbody {font-size: 10pt}\rh2{\rtext-decoration: underline;\rline-height: 5pt;\rtext-align: center;\rpadding-top: 30px;\r}\r\rBy convention, “df” will refer to a dataframe object, while “Series” will refer to a series object.\nImporting\rImporting the Libraries\rimport pandas as pd\rimport numpy as np #NumPy library required by Pandas library\r\rRead csv file data\rdf = pd.read_csv(file_path, index_col=None)\r\r\rAbout dataset\rCheck column names\rdf.columns\rSeries.name\r\rCheck shape of object\rdf.shape\rSeries.shape\r\rColumns of a specific data type type\rdf.dtypes == \u0026#39;object\u0026#39;\r\rDescribe data\rdf.describe()\r\rUnique vs Nunique\rfor col in df.columns: #for loop to get column names\rdf[col].unique() #returns unique values in column \u0026#39;col\u0026#39;\rdf[col].nunique() #returns unique values in column AND drop NAs\r\r\rSlicing and Filtering\rFilter\rdf.filter(items=, like=None)\r\rIloc \rdf.iloc[row_position, col_position] #general format\rCOPY of dataframe is slice is returned.

Then you’ve come to the right place!\r\r\r\rIf you do not have true proportion or estimated probabilities for your simulation, then this may not help you!\n\r\rPremise\rSay you want to understand how randomness works, and you want to roll a 12-sided die and see how many times it lands on 1. You’ll do roll a die 100, 10,000, 1,000,000 times.\nNote: Every side of the die has a probability of 1/12, but the outcome of each roll is random and independent from one another.\r\rStep 0: Set the seed to some arbitrary constant. (Optional)\rset.seed(2009, sample.kind=\u0026quot;Rounding\u0026quot;) #for R 3.6 and later\rset.seed(2009) #for 3.5 and older\rIf you wish to observe the same results for lower numbers of draws, you can place this at the start of your script.\r\rStep 1: Construct a method for sampling.\rNs = c(100, 10000, 1000000) #number of simulations\rsimulations \u0026lt;- sapply(Ns, function(N){\rsim \u0026lt;- sample(c(1, -1), N, replace=TRUE, prob=c(1/12, 11/12)) #sampling\rmean(sim == 1) #find the proportion of rolls which are 1 (success)\r})\r\r\rSample.Size\rProportion.Observed\r\r\r\r1e+02\r0.040000\r\r1e+04\r0.079900\r\r1e+06\r0.082951\r\r\r\rThe sample function takes N rolls (with replacement). The result can either be 1; a success (landing on 1), or -1; a failure (not landing on one). The keyword argument “prob” defines the probability for possible events success or failure.\nAs you can see from the results, the proportion of rolls landing on 1 converges to the probability we defined it to be (1/12 = 0.0833), as the number of rolls increases.\n\rFor Understanding\r\rTo close, it may be good to point out a common misconception when it comes to expectation. Say if you and your friends are tossing a coin and it lands on heads, you might be tempted to say “The next one will be tails!”, but that’s wrong. We know logically that the probability of either side landing is 1/2, but we would only be able to observe this when we sum up the results of maybe a thousand or hundred thousand rolls, as we have just done.\rThe Law of Large Numbers (or the Law of Averages) states that as the number of draws (rolls) increases, the standard error (standard deviation but for samples) of the expected value approaches 0. In which case, the expected value converges to the probability we defined.\r\rEnrichment\r\rYou can try to compute for the standard error for each simulation using the formula:\n\\(SE[\\overline{X}]=|b-a|*\\frac{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}{N}\\)\nwhere SE means standard error;\nX_bar is the sample random variable;\na and b are the values we attribute to success and failure (i.e. 1 and -1);\np is the probability of success (i.e. 1/12);\nand N is the sample size.\r\r\nNOTE: For cases wherein the probability is not defined, we can use the replicate function that takes two arguments. The second argument defines a line or set of lines to replicate, while the first argument is the number of times you wish to repeat the second argument.\nExample: Creating a list of sample means.\narray # a non-empty numeric array of length 100,000\rB \u0026lt;- 1000 # number of replications\rN \u0026lt;- 100 # number of samples\rsample_means \u0026lt;- replicate(B, {\rsample_array \u0026lt;- sample(array, N, replace=TRUE)\rmean(sample_array) #like a function; this is returned\r})\r\r\r","date":1593820800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594522504,"objectID":"ff9c185f89c790c3601884e1e08fbc15","permalink":"/post/monte-carlo-simulations/monte-carlo-simulations/","publishdate":"2020-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/monte-carlo-simulations/monte-carlo-simulations/","section":"post","summary":"After a bad roll, should you expect your luck to turn?","tags":["Modeling","Statistics and Probability"],"title":"Monte Carlo Simulations","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"\r\rsummary h3{ display: inline-block;\rfont-size:20px;\rfont-family:\"Quicksand\";\rmargin-top: 0;\rmargin-bottom: 0;\r}\rp{font-size: 80%; text-indent: 2em;\rline-height: 0.5}\r\r\r\r\rUniversity of Toronto\r\r\r\r\r\rYear\rCourse.Code\rName\rGrade\r\r\r\r2\rBCH210\rBiochemistry I\rIP\r\r2\rBIO230\rFrom Genes to Organisms\rIP\r\r2\rMAT223\rLinear Algebra I\rIP\r\r2\rPSY270\rIntro to Cognitive Psychology\rIP\r\r2\rSTA299\rResearch Opportunity Program\rIP\r\r1\rBIO120\rAdaptation and Biodiversity\rA\r\r1\rBIO130\rMolecular and Cell Biology\rA+\r\r1\rCHM135\rChemistry: Physical Principles\rA-\r\r1\rCHM136\rIntroductory Organic Chemistry I\rA-\r\r1\rCSC108\rIntroduction to Computer Programming\rA+\r\r1\rMAT135\rCalculus I\rA\r\r1\rMAT136\rCalculus II\rA-\r\r1\rIMM250\rThe Immune System and Infectious Disease\rA\r\r1\rNMC101\rLand of the Pharaohs\rB+\r\r1\rPSY101\rIntroductory Psychology\rA\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rEdX\r\r\r\r\rHarvardX Data Science: R Basics\nHarvardX Data Science: Visualization\nHarvardX Data Science: Probability\nHarvardX Data Science: Inference and Modeling\nHarvardX Data Science: Productivity Tools\n\r\r\r\r\rKaggle Micro-courses\r\r\r\r\rIntro to Machine Learning\nIntermediate Machine Learning\nFeature Engineering\nDeep Learning\nIntro to SQL\n\r\r","date":1593816601,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593816601,"objectID":"1a76532d6ea387b255a790f767e744b0","permalink":"/courses/","publishdate":"2020-07-03T18:50:01-04:00","relpermalink":"/courses/","section":"","summary":"summary h3{ display: inline-block;\rfont-size:20px;\rfont-family:\"Quicksand\";\rmargin-top: 0;\rmargin-bottom: 0;\r}\rp{font-size: 80%; text-indent: 2em;\rline-height: 0.5}\r\r\r\r\rUniversity of Toronto\r\r\r\r\r\rYear\rCourse.","tags":[],"title":"Courses Completed","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593648000,"objectID":"c9b5771543b03b8149b612b630936a56","permalink":"/experience/","publishdate":"2020-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/experience/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Experience","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Others"],"content":"\rHere lies my first blog post.\n","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"56667fe58b016d061a43b558957c66ec","permalink":"/post/first/a-first/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/first/a-first/","section":"post","summary":"One to set the record books","tags":null,"title":"A First","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1592006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592006400,"objectID":"f1c50808d7bbdfb030283c0c4c548698","permalink":"/project/covid19-policy-hackathon-int/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/covid19-policy-hackathon-int/","section":"project","summary":"In a team of five, designed a policy memo to address the issues of schools closing and plan for safe school reopening in Nigeria.","tags":["Other"],"title":"COVID19 Policy Hackathon","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590883200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590883200,"objectID":"541e1b806fdd8aa33a6a209161bac8d0","permalink":"/project/unbdc2020-ext/","publishdate":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/unbdc2020-ext/","section":"project","summary":"Correlation between case fatality rate and days since index case for countries in Southern Europe","tags":["Data Visualization"],"title":"UnBDC 2020 Entry","type":"project"},{"authors":["Stanley Z.
